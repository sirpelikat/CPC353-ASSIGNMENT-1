ID,RESTAURANT,REVIEW
1,Uncle Lanz Nasi Lemak,"The portion was crazy generous for their price. They gave so much lung meat for the nasi lemak paru goreng for only RM10 (excluded with additional rice). However the taste is just decent and good enough. Chicken chop was also not bad. All and all, it's a good place to fill up your tummy on any day"
2,My Own Cafe,"What a gem! Love it when by chance you stumble onto something unexpectedly. While the menu is limited to 3 dishes and a few drink options. This would have to be close to perfection. Dare I say, travel just to have this dish!
I had the Lemak Laksa, with a side of dipping spring rolls - what a balance of flavours OMG. Seriously the best delicate Laksa and spring rolls I have ever had."
3,Tek Sen Restaurant,"Tek Sen is a popular spot in Georgetown, Penang, and it definitely lives up to its reputation for tasty food. The dishes were delicious and flavorful, though the prices are a bit on the higher side compared to typical local eateries.

Be prepared for a very long wait — the queue was incredibly long, and we had to wait quite a while to get a table. If you don't mind waiting, it's worth a try for the quality of the food."
4,Beach St. Bistrot,"Excellent dishes with well dosed flavors.
From starter to dessert I feasted (onion soup, pan-fried clams and profiterole), my husband also with the wagyu beef burger and the children’s menu is also very tasteful.
Interesting drinks menu.
Perfect Service and pleasant surroundings.
I highly recommend."
5,Kebaya Dining Room,"Recommended by a friend from Penang. The wow factor is the terrace of seven houses restored and converted into a stunning dining room. Met by Kris, delightful lady who explained the building and history. Visited by Prince, now King Charles III and even a scene from Rich Crazy Asians shot in the courtyard. The menu allows you to choose a number of dishes at a fixed price, there are cocktails and a sensible wine and drinks list. We ate a very good spring roll and small pies filled with pomfret as appetisers. Then dishes of duck, prawns, egg plant and green mango salad with rice. Refined food but despite skipping lunch and walking miles there was too much for us two! No way we could manage dessert."
6,Two Frenchies Cafe Bistrot,"Real French food cooked by real French chefs. Extensive selection and wine to match. We had hallobat, mushroom soup and slow cooked beef followed by creme brûlée and a fruit parfait. The food was delicious. The restraunt was clean and well presented the staff were helpful and attentive particularly Imran.
Considering the quality of the food, much imported such as the hallobat from Norway, the prices were not expensive. We had the best meal we have had in Malaysia"
7,Heritage Artisans,"My friend and i tried six Penang dishes cooked by Chef Su Pei, most of them are Penang Peranakan or specific to Penang.

My favourite was the buah keras.prawns. Su Pei explained that her buah keras nut fillings are not mixed with any meat or prawns, like how it is done in Melaka or Penang. I found the buah keras to be even more full bodied and aromatic.

Seconding in close as my favourite would be the black glutinous rice dessert with coconut ice cream and biscuit crumble. The tezture glutinous rice is al dente and is reintrepretation of this classic dessert.

Su Pei gives a cultural and personal cusine to each item and is able to answer questions very well.

The clean and quiet environment in the restaurant makes dining so pleasant. I had a good time!"
8,Rossi Italian,"The atmosphere feels cozy and upscale without trying too hard, and the service is warm in that genuine, attentive way. The pasta comes out perfectly cooked, sauces rich and balanced, and their pizza has that lovely crisp-chewy texture you can’t fake. Portions are just right and the ingredients taste fresh. It’s the kind of place where you finish your meal already planning your next visit. Definitely one of the better Italian spots in Penang."
9,Andrew's Kampung,"Based on other good reviews, we tried this restaurant. It was quiet when we arrived however, it got busy later. We had samosa and spring rolls first. They were huge! Then Thai green chicken curry and Malaysian beef. Both were very tasty. I would have liked less onion in my green curry. The fried ice cream was delicious. Recommend!"
10,Laksalicious,"We’ve been going through Malaysia for a week and a half now and this site has entered the top five of favorites without any doubt.
We ate the Asam Laksa, which carries coconut milk and has a very light spicy touch, rice noodles... super rich. There were more spicy options but in our case we wanted to rest a bit.
Desserts, without being the best, were rich and very different, which always gives joy to try new things.
If I was in Bilbao we would repeat."
11,Red Garden Food Paradise & Night Market,"Good selection of stalls selling all sorts of Asian food styles. Very friendly vendors. Pick your dish, pay and give your table number and the food will come. Easy to over order. Prices very good as is quality but this isn’t fine dining. You may want to take hand gel and wipes, I’m sure there are sinks to wash hands but I didn’t spot them. There are drinks vendors who circulate selling soft drinks and beers. Cash only as far as I could tell."
12,Mews Cafe,"We have visited Penang twice in the last 2 years and we have dined here repeatedly since our first meal. The carefully curated menu offers delicious Malay food served by attentive wait staff. Don't miss the specials, banana fritters, and pineapple mint frappe. Located in historic Georgetown next to the beautiful Muntri Mews Heritage Hotel. We felt like special guests eating unique food in a memorable setting. (Outdoor/indoor dining with a/c.)"
13,Indigo Restaurant at The Blue Mansion,"Absolutely 1st class from start to finish. We had been on the tour of the Blue Mansion a couple of days prior and thought the restaurant looked like a
really special place to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary, and we weren't wrong! The room is stunning, all of the food was delicious, the Chinese wine was spectacular and the whole experience was made even more special by Vincent and his team, especially Jalal who was an absolute superstar!
We loved the evening so much we booked a table for lunch on our last day in Penang a few days later, and again it was fabulous, and again so was Jalal.
Beautiful place with first class service. Thank you so much for helping to make our Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations so memorable."
14,Jawi House Cafe Gallery,"Excellent service and wonderful food!
We had the green mango salad, the best Poppadoms, a yogurt cucumber dish and another salad. The portions were huge, the salads fresh and crisp.
The server was attentive and did a great job of explaining things.
The ambience was lovely, nice and cool when it was so hot outside.
We would definitely go again!"
15,Living Room Cafe Bar & Gallery,"Excellent home cooked food along with a nice cold beer what more could you want. We went in here a few times at night the food was absolutely delicious & at a reasonable price cooked & served by Amy the owner. What makes it special is Ben her husband serves your drinks & then sings & plays his guitar plus any other customer who braves it to stand up & sing , such a lovely couple & can honestly say our favourite place to eat & drink, keep enjoying your holidays

16,Orinea Restaurant,"The menu leans French with Malaysian heritage. The food was absolutely perfect. Staff are friendly, attentive, and seem genuinely pleased to explain dishes. Perfect for a date, anniversary, or a nice evening out. The music is low‑key, allowing conversation. Lighting is dim but not gloomy. Tables are spaced enough for privacy. Dress code leans smart casual"
17,Kota Dine & Coffee,"This wonderful cafe is located with Fort Cornwallis. Visitors should make use of the RM10 voucher that comes with the entrance fee at this cafe.
Its location is unfortunate. I doubt many Malaysians, especially Penangites, will want to pay a RM20 (RM40 each for foreigners) entrance fee to dine at this cafe even though there is a RM10 voucher.
I believe that as a result of the entrance fee, there were not many diners when we were there. But that is by no means a reflection of the food and service.
The food here is fusion and creative. It is a good starting point in the culinary journey of a visitor to Penang who is not familiar with the local food."
18,Junk Cafe,"Authentic venue, music and decoration with personality. Although the only bad thing to say is that the music is too loud and you can't talk.
Super correct price, delicious and tasty food and contiguous dishes. Burgers come with potatoes, sweet potatoes or salad.
Super recommended!"
19,Long Beach,"This is our favourite hawker centre in Penang. Nice & clean with a buzzing vibe.
We always enjoy the food options available & the cheap pricing.
Pick a table. Order what you like to eat & drink. They’ll bring it to your table number where you then pay them in cash. Most stalls will do tap & go at time of ordering, but prefer cash.
Always a great night out trying different dishes & watching people from all over the world."
20,Holy Guacamole - Love Lane,"Had high hopes for this place after seeing some pretty good reviews, but oh my, how disappointing!
We waited ages for the food to arrive.
The food was so bland—beef tough as old boots, chicken fajitas with literally no seasoning whatsoever, and chicken satay fajitas tasted as though they'd been cooked on a grill with fish (vile). If I had wanted fish, I would have asked for fish. It tasted rank.
The band (who came on after we started to eat) was very loud, and we could hardly hear ourselves think, let alone speak! Some people might like this, so just giving an honest insight for those considering a visit.
Don't go with any expectations; we may have been there on a bad night. It was busy, which meant the food was cold.
We didn't get a chance to complain because we couldn't get hold of a waiter—not until our bill arrived, and by that point, we just wanted to leave."
